Distribute task execution across time in an asyncio environment, so as to apply
flow control policies.

This started as a fork of [throttler]. It has now diverged heavily from it in
some parts, but its main purpose is still to provide tools (Python classes)
that allow to control the execution of coroutines across time, limiting by
different criteria (e.g. task rate or concurrent execution).


## Install

Just
```sh
pip install async-flow-control
```
The package has no dependencies.

To build the wheel package from source, a `Makefile` is provided. Just use
`make pkg`


## Usage

The main entry point is the [`AsyncThrottler`] class. This is a dispatcher
class, and will instantiate the appropriate class that controls execution by
either:
 * ensuring it is limited to a maximum task rate, or
 * ensured it is limited to a maximum number of simultaneous processes, or
 * ensured there is a minimum space between task executions.

The main API to use the created objects is by enclosing task execution inside the
async context manager given by the object. This procedure will work for any of
the instantiated classes (some classes have also their own alternative methods).


## Decorators

In addition to the class-based context manager, the same functionality is also
available via a set of [function decorators] that can be used to wrap task
execution and impose the limits.


## Logging

All classes can perform [logging] of waiting times, by using additional
arguments in their constructors.


## Timer

As complementary functionality, a [`Timer`] class can be used to wrap processing
blocks and compute execution time. It also provides a decorator.
